# 6 DAY (instrukcje warunkowe)

# Conditional statements is needed to making conditions
# For example, if playernick == blacklist: print(playernick + "is trying to join the game, but he is on backlisted")
# You can make conditions to check lenght of the playernick and print that this isn't allowed lenght of nick

# I start by making variables
a = 5
b = 5

# Here is conditional statement
if a == b:
    print("a is equal to b")
elif a >= b:
    print("a is greater than or equal to b")
elif a <= b:
    print("a is smaller than or equal to b")
else:
    print("a is not equal to b")

# 6th day complete!
