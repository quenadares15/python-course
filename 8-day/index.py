# 8 DAY

# Break and continue is needed to make for example counter or making of the game

# I started by creating variable i and j
# Then making while loop that if i variable will greater than 6, print i
# And i is greater or equal than 1
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")

j = 0
while i < 6:
  j += 1
  if j == 3:
    continue
  print(i)

# 8 day complete!
