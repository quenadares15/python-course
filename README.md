# 30-days Python Course

With this course you can learn the basics of Python programming language by
practice - by running the code by yourself and modifying it.

## How can I use this?

First you need to install the Python interpreter (the program that is able to
read the code written in Python and execute it) and the code editor (the program
which you will edit your Python code in, we recommend either PyCharm or VSCode).
If you haven't done it before,
[here are the instructions](#installing-python-and-code-editor).

Once you installed all of the tools you have to clone this repository
(`git clone https://github.com/quenadares15/python-course`; if you're not
familiar with Git, just
[click here and download zip](https://github.com/quenadares15/python-course/archive/main.zip)).

The next step is to open the cloned repository/downloaded and extracted zip in
the code editor. To do it in VSCode, open it and go to `File -> Open Folder...`.
Then select the folder, and... you are ready to learn Python!

To run Python program in VSCode, open the integrated terminal
(`Terminal -> New Terminal`) and type `python X-day/index.py` (e.g. for 1-st day
you'll type `python 1-day/index.py`)

**Pro tip**: Instead of typing `python X-day/index.py` all the time you want to
run the program again, just press the arrow-up key, then enter.

### Installing Python and code editor

To install the Python interpreter, go to
[the official Python's download website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
click `Download Python`. Then just install it as you usually install other
programs, but **don't forget to check the `Add Python to PATH` checkbox**.  
To check if you have installed Python properly, open `cmd` (Win+R and type
`cmd`) and then type `python`. If you have installed Python properly, you will
not see any errors.

You will also need a text editor. We recommend you to install either
[Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (just text editor)
or [Jetbrains PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (full Integrated
Development Environment (IDE)). Download one of these apps and install. If you've
chosen VSCode, install
[this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) -
you don't need to do this, but it will improve your Python experience in this
editor.

We will show how to use VSCode, but the code will work in PyCharm as well.
