# 4TH DAY
# Comparison operators

# All of the comparison operators returns a bool. It means the result of the
# comparison will be either True or False.

# Equality operator
# a == b
print('EQUALITY')

equality = 2 == 2 # Will be True, because 2 is equal 2
print('2 == 2 -> ' + str(equality))

equality = 3 == 5 # Will be False, because 3 is NOT equal 5

# Inequality operator
# a != b

inequality = 15 != 15 # Will be False, because 15 IS equal 15
print('15 != 15 -> ' + str(inequality))

# Greater than operator
# a > b
