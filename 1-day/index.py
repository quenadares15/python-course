# 1 DAY

# Show text in console
print("\nHello World")
input("\nPress Enter to continue\n")
# Use print() to show text in console
# Before the program exits, the user must press the enter key - input()
# If you want to get empty line in console, write \n in string

# Define variable
variable1 = "string"
variable2 = 123 #number
# To define variable write: 
# name-of-variable = "string" / 123 

# Showing variable in console
a = "variable a"
b = "variable b"
print(a)
print(b)
# Showing content of variable
input("\nPress Enter to continue\n")

# Getting value from the user
name = input("What's your name?: ")
print("Hello " + name)
input("Press Enter to exit")
# First, you need to define variable
# Next, you need to use print() to show content of variable
# Use + to connect strings

# Congratulations, 1 day complete!
